Robot controlled through WiFi. Could be controlled through the internet 
as well. In the last case WiFi access point (most probably laptop) is 
used as intermediate retranslator. 

Robot's software is designed to work in LAN, Internet and through I2P 
network (www.i2p2.de). In the last case there is relatively large ping 
(up to two seconds) but one doesn't need port forwarding or external IP.

Tested in IPV6 with Teredo and Mitedo (on Linux).

Software is tested in Windows XP and XUbuntu Linux.

Software is designed to be multiclient. One person can control robot while 
others may observe it's motion. When one releases robot control another 
person may get it and drive robot. Also simple chat is implementer for 
people be able to talk to each other while driving the robot through the 
internet.

Hardware is based on D-Link Dir-320 router. It is equiped with Dagu 
RP5 chassis. It has two tracks for moving and turning and two servos 
for yawing and pitching a camera. Motors controller is attached to the 
router through USB.

Motors control board is based on two AVR microcontrollers. One for USB 
communication and the other one for handling DC track motors and camera 
servos.
